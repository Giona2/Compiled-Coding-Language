For now I'm focusing on a minimal subset, but eventually I plan to implement function calls and control flow. My ideal end point would be to create a system library that would handle more complex tasks in a more modular way. Take the following as an example:
```custom
import std::exit()

int i = 0;
exit(0)
```
